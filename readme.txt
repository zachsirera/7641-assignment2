1.	Clone repository here: https://github.com/zachsirera/7641-assignment2


2. 	run "pip3 install -r requirements.txt" to get all necessary libraries
		

3. 	Part one is contained in "main.py". All of the functions exist to perform some portion of the grid search for one or more of the algorithms. 
	Their names describe exactly what function they perform. 
	Invoking any one of them should create a png figure and save it to the current folder. 
	All of the function calls have been commented out to prevent any inadvertant operation. 


4.	Part two is contained in "train.py". All of the functions exist to perform some portion of the neural network training. 
	Their names describe exactly what function they perform. 
	Invoking any one of them should create a png figure and save it to the current folder. 
	All of the function calls have been commented out to prevent any inadvertant operation. 

5. All figures generated can be found in the figures subfolder.
